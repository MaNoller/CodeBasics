#Write a function called calculate_area that takes base and height as an input and returns and area of a triangle. Equation of an area of a triangle is,
#area = (1/2)*base*height
def calculate_area(base,height):
    return (1/2)*base*height

#Modify above function to take third parameter shape type. It can be either "triangle" or "rectangle". Based on shape type it will calculate area.
#Equation of rectangle's area is,
#rectangle area=length*width
#If no shape is supplied then it should take triangle as a default shape
def calculate_area(base,height,form="triangle"):
    if form=="triangle":
        return (1/2)*base*height
    elif form=="rectangle":
        return base*height
    else:
        return "Invalid input"

#Testcases taken from exercise:
base=10
height=5
triangle_area=calculate_area(base,height,"triangle")
print("Area of triangle is:",triangle_area)

# Calculate area of a rectangle whose length is 20 and width is 30
length=20
width=30
rectangle_area=calculate_area(length,width,"rectangle")
print("Area of rectangle is:",rectangle_area)

# Calculate area of a triangle without supplying shape argument in a function call
triangle_area=calculate_area(base,height) # Here third argument is missing
print("Area of triangle with no shape supplied: ",triangle_area)


Write a function called print_pattern that takes integer number as an argument and prints following pattern if input number is 3,
*
**
***
if input is 4 then it should print

*
**
***
****
Basically number of lines it prints is equal to that number. (Hint: you need to use two for loops)

def print_pattern(n=5):
    s=''
    print(n)
    for i in range(n):
        s+='*'
        print(s)

print_pattern(3)
print_pattern()
